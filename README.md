This repository has followng structure:
	1. `check_libraries.py` -- this will tell you if your environment is ok.

	2. `sytax.py` a very brief introduction.
	
	3. `simple.py` and `Utilities.py` shows you some *ROOT* integration. _Don't care about `GetPseudoRandomData` function._

	4. If everything is clear `normal.py` shows how to draw multiple histograms._Don't care about `GetPseudoRandomData` function_.

	5. It's a bit tough but you can run `ResonanceDecay.py`. It performs three-particledecay. All information is stored inside `Observables.py`.
